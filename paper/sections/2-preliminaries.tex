% The advent of machine learning has brought significant advancements to various domains, including healthcare. In recent years, the use of machine learning (ML) in health applications has increased exponentially, resulting in improved diagnostics, 
% personalized treatment plans, and more efficient resource allocation. However, due to the big risk of deploying ML models for high-stake decisions, together with the dynamic and data-rich nature of healthcare data, it becomes of special importance to building more robust and reliable systems for these applications. 
% Integrating continuous, active, and online learning (CAOL) techniques in the design of machine-learning platforms can further enhance the robustness of actively deployed models against mispredictions, data/concept drifts, and misalignment. This work reviews the theoretical aspects and potential benefits of employing CAOL 
% in developing machine-learning systems and applying it to a platform that hosts models mainly trained in the context of Tuberculosis detection. 
% We address the key characteristics of these methods and propose some promising techniques for their implementation.

\begin{quote}
	You should know no one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pain because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure great pleasure
	% Who of us ever undertake laborious exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? 
	% At the same time, who has any right to find fault with someone who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?
	[\ldots]
	In a time of freedom, when our power of choice is untrammeled and when nothing prevents us from doing what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided [\ldots]
	% But owing to the claims of duty it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. 
	But the wise man should always hold himself to the following principle of selection: \textit{Reject pleasure to secure greater pleasures, or else endure pains to avoid worse pains.}
