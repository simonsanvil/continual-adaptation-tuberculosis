    \section{Relevant Learning Paradigms and Adaptation Techniques} \label{sec:relevant_techniques} \info{6-7 pages}

    Throughout this section, we consider a set of novel techniques that have been proposed in the literature that are related to ML model adaptation. One of the key aspects in selecting which techniques to include in this section (besides their relevance to the topic) was the technical feasibility of implementing them as \textit{tactics} (as described in section \ref{sec:lifelong_adaptive_systems}) in a self-adaptive system. 

    The idea is that some of the techniques described below may be used as the basis for the process of adaptation of an ML model after it has been detected (through specific monitorization) that some form of degradation has occurred. The goal would be to then use some of these techniques (or a combination of them) as a way to improve performance.

    \subsection{Transfer Learning and Domain Adaptation} \label{sec:transfer_learning} \info{1 page}

    Transfer learning is a technique that aims to improve the performance of a model by transferring the knowledge of a pre-trained model to a new task. This is achieved by training the model on a large dataset and then fine-tuning it on a smaller dataset for the new task. The model is trained on a large dataset to learn general features that can be applied to a wide range of tasks. The model is then `fine-tuned' on the smaller dataset to learn task-specific features that are relevant to the new task \cite{pan_survey_2010}.

	
	\subsection{Continual Learning} \label{sec:continual_learning} \info{1.25 pages}
	
	 Continual learning refers to the concept of constantly updating a model as new information arrives, allowing it to adapt to changing data \cite{huyen_designing_2022}. This constant change in the data distribution requires models to be updated periodically to maintain their accuracy and relevance, prevent model stagnation, and extend their relevance to the application.

     We can consider two frameworks for implementing continual learning in a machine-learning system. We refer to the first as \textit{offline learning}, where the model is updated periodically using a batch of data collected over time. Offline learning can be additionally subdivided into two categories based on how data is monitored prior to updating a model: \textit{passive} and \textit{active} continual learning.

     The model is updated passively when the data is collected over a fixed period of time (e.g., every six months) or after a fixed number of instances have been processed and labeled (e.g., every 1000 new instances). Conversely, the model is updated actively when we update only when the model's performance drops below a certain threshold or when the system detects a significant change in the data distribution \cite{huyen_designing_2022}.

    Online learning is the second framework for implementing continual learning. The difference between online and offline learning is that, with the former, the model is updated as soon as new data arrives, with every new instance - or small batch of instances - being used to update the model. Because this approach tends to be more computationally expensive than offline learning and suffers from well-known problems such as catastrophic forgetting \cite{huyen_designing_2022}, it is often used in conjunction with offline learning to improve the model's performance. 

    Continual learning is well-suited for healthcare applications where data arrives in a stream (e.g., wearable health monitors, electronic medical records, and imaging systems). It is also useful in terms of 


    \subsection{Active Learning} \label{sec:active_learning} \info{1.25 pages}
 
     Active learning strategies selectively acquire data based on their informativeness or uncertainty to the model. Its value comes from allowing the model to guide its own data acquisition process, thus potentially reducing the need for vast - or unnecessary - amounts of pre-labeled data before a model is trained or updated \cite{huyen_designing_2022, chen_study_2015, figueroa_predicting_2012}. 
     This is particularly important in health applications, as the availability of annotated medical data is often limited due to privacy concerns, expert time constraints, and the complexity of pathological findings.
     
     Active learning enables the development of accurate models using significantly less labeled data, paving the way for more efficient and cost-effective machine-learning platforms. Some of the most common active learning strategies include uncertainty sampling, query by committee, and expected model change. 

     \subsection{Knowledge Distillation} \label{sec:knowledge_distillation} \info{0.5 pages}

    Knowledge distillation is a technique that aims to improve the performance of a model by transferring the knowledge of a larger model (teacher) to a smaller model (student). This is achieved by training the student model to mimic the predictions of the teacher model. The student model is trained on the same data as the teacher model, but it is trained to predict the probabilities of the teacher model's predictions instead of the actual labels. This allows the student model to learn from the teacher model's mistakes and improve its performance on the given task \cite{hinton_distilling_2015}.

    \subsection{Adversarial Training} \label{sec:adversarial_training} \unsure{Unsure about keeping this section}

    Adversarial attacks on machine learning occur when an attacker produces inputs that are intentionally designed to be misclassified by a specific ML model. They are created by adding small perturbations to the input data that may be imperceptible to humans but can cause the model to make a wrong prediction.
    
    Adversarial examples are a major concern in healthcare applications, an attacker may purposely create adversarial examples to fool the model into making incorrect predictions, which can have serious consequences like misdiagnosing a patient or prescribing them unnecessary treatment \cite{finlayson_adversarial_2019}. 
    % Figure \ref{fig:medical_adversarial_attacks} shows examples of adversarial examples in health .

    \begin{figure}[h]
        \includegraphics[width=0.65\linewidth]{figures/medical-adversarial-attacks.jpeg}
        \caption{Adversarial examples in health from Finlayson et al. (2019) \cite{finlayson_adversarial_2019}.}
        \label{fig:medical_adversarial_attacks}
    \end{figure}
    % \vspace*{-0.5cm}

    Furthermore, adversarial examples shine a light on the black-box nature of several types of ML models. The fact that these models can be fooled by small changes that are not perceptible to any expert raises questions about their general reliability and trustworthiness. This is why this phenomenon is an active area of research in the field \cite{finlayson_adversarial_2019}.

    One way to deal with adversarial attacks is by choosing models that are more robust to these examples. Goodfellow et al. 2015, for example, favors the use of nonlinear model families like RBF networks or using regularization strategies like dropout, weight decay, or gradient masking to improve the robustness of the model \autocite{goodfellowExplainingHarnessingAdversarial2015}.
    
    Another popular approach to make ML models more robust to these attacks is by feeding them directly adversarial examples on their training data. This is known as \textit{adversarial training}. Methods like the Fast Gradient Sign Method \cite{goodfellowExplainingHarnessingAdversarial2015} (FGSM) or the more recent Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) \autocite{madryDeepLearningModels2019}  can be used to generate adversarial examples and train the model to be robust to them.

    \subsection{Federated Learning} \label{sec:federated_learning} \info{1 page}

    Federated learning is the concept of training a model using data from multiple sources without having to share the data itself. This is achieved by training the model on each source separately and then combining the results to obtain a final model. This technique is particularly useful in healthcare applications, where data privacy is a major concern. It allows us to train models on data from multiple sources without having to share the data itself, thus preserving the privacy of the patients \cite{joshi_federated_2022}.

    \section{Literature Review} \label{sec:literature_review} \todo{4-5 pages}

    As mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, this section provides a detailed overview of the most relevant work in the literature related to the topics of this thesis. It is meant for readers who want to dive more into the details of the techniques studied, how they achieved state-of-the-art performance, their overall contributions, and how they relate to the problems posed in this work.

    \subsection{Computer Vision and DL-Based Object-Detection Techniques } \label{sec:computer_vision_sota}

    This thesis focuses on the application of computer vision (CV) techniques applied to the detection of tuberculosis. Thus, we consider it important to give an overview of the most important work in the literature in CV with the goal that the discussion here also serves as a good reference for the proposed solution and for the techniques that will be introduced in the upcoming sections. 
    
    Since CV is a very broad field, we will not be able to cover all the relevant work in the literature. Instead, since the problem in this work relates more to the tasks of image classification and object detection using Deep Learning (DL) algorithms (to identify tuberculosis), we will limit our scope to the most relevant work in those areas.

    First of all, we consider it important to highlight the importance of DL techniques in CV. The immense popularity that DL has gained in the area of CV can be traced back to 2012 when Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures like AlexNet \cite{dengImageNetLargescaleHierarchical2009} started showing breakthrough performance for solving image classification tasks in recognized competitions like the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ISLVR) \cite{krizhevskyImageNetClassificationDeep2012}.
    
    CNNs are a type of neural network that uses \textit{convolutional layers} (which can be thought of as a set of functions that learn image filters through the use of convolutional operations) to extract features from the input image \autocite{goodfellowDeepLearning2016}. CNNs were first introduced by Yann LeCun in 1989 \cite{lecunBackpropagationAppliedHandwritten1989}, 30 years before ImageNet. It has since been used to achieve SOTA performance on a wide range of CV tasks, including object-detection \cite{lecun_deep_2015,zouObjectDetection202023b}.

    Then, bringing the focus specifically to Deep Learning for object detection tasks
    (ignoring the breakthroughs that CNNs have allowed in tasks like image segmentation, captioning, or generation), we can find that most literature is divided into two main approaches to the problem: \textit{two-stage} and \textit{one-stage} object detectors.
    
    \textbf{Two-stage object detection} methods first propose a set of candidate regions in the image (the \textit{region proposal} stage) and then classify each region as either containing an object or not (the \textit{classification} stage). \textbf{One-stage object detection} methods, on the other hand, directly predict the bounding boxes and class labels of the objects in the image \cite{zouObjectDetection202023b}. 
    
    Figure \ref{fig:fastrcnn_vs_yolo} shows a comparison between the two approaches:
    \clearpage
    
    \begin{figure}[h]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/fastrcnn_vs_yolo}
        \caption{(a) A two-stage Faster R-CNN object detector. (b) A one-stage YOLO object detector. Figure from Li et al. (2019) \cite{liEnhancedBirdDetection2019}.
        % The two-stage detector requires two forward passes through the network, while the one-stage detector only requires one. 
        }
        \label{fig:fastrcnn_vs_yolo}
    \end{figure}

    Generally, the advantage of two-stage detectors is that they tend to be more accurate than one-stage detectors, as the region proposal stage allows them to focus on a smaller set of candidate regions that can be then individually discriminated by the classification stage. However, this comes at the cost of being slower than one-stage detectors since they require two inference steps through the network \cite{zouObjectDetection202023b}.

    The SOTA status of two-stage object detection methods precedes that of their one-stage counterpart. The popularity of CNNs in the CV field in the early 2010s led to the development of \textbf{RCNN} (2014), an architecture that first proposes image regions by selective search \cite{uijlingsSelectiveSearchObject2013}, which are then rescaled and fed into a CNN to extract features and finally use a linear classifier to predict their label \cite{girshickRichFeatureHierarchies2014}. 
    
    The success of RCNN for object detection tasks was followed by SPP-Net (2014), which introduced a Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) layer to allow the model to process images of arbitrary sizes without rescaling them \cite{heSpatialPyramidPooling2014}. Then came \textbf{Fast RCNN} and \textbf{Faster R-CNN} in 2015 \cite{girshickFastRCNN2015,renFasterRCNNRealTime2016}, who respectively improved on RCNN by training the detector and bounding box regressor jointly, and by using a Region Proposal Network (RPN) to replace the selective search algorithm used in previous models. 
    
    While two-stage detectors were achieving state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy, they were not fast enough to be used for real-time applications or on embedded devices such as smartphones. This led to the need to develop faster object detection methods that could be used for such purposes \cite{zouObjectDetection202023b}.
    
    It wasn't until 2016 that one-stage object detectors reached this milestone with the proposal of the \textbf{YOLO} (You Only Look Once) model \cite{redmonYouOnlyLook2016}. Unlike RCNN-based approaches, YOLO poses the task as a regression problem, where the model directly predicts the bounding boxes and class probabilities of the objects in one evaluation, allowing the system to be optimized in an end-to-end fashion. 
    % This approach allowed YOLO to achieve real-time performance while still being comparable to Faster R-CNN.

     YOLO marked a turning point in the field, a surge in the popularity of one-stage detectors led to more methods being proposed in the following years, from more adequate loss functions like RetinaNet's Focal Loss \cite{linFocalLossDense2018} to subsequent developments to YOLO's architecture like YOLO9K (2016), YOLOv3 (2018), and YOLOv8 (2023) \cite{redmonYOLO9000BetterFaster2016, redmonYOLOv3IncrementalImprovement2018, Jocher_YOLO_by_Ultralytics_2023} that improved on the original model's performance, allowing it to retain SOTA performance.
     
     In this age, single-stage object detectors dominate the general benchmarks (e.g.: ISLVR, COCO \cite{linMicrosoftCOCOCommon2015}, PASCAL VOC \cite{everinghamPascalVisualObject2010}) in both accuracy and speed. More recent methods use Transformer architectures \cite{vaswaniAttentionAllYou2017} to overcome the limitations of traditional CNNs in terms of parallelization and locally restrictive receptive field, showing that abandoning convolutions in favor of an attention-only approach can also achieve SOTA \cite{ carionEndtoEndObjectDetection2020,zhuDeformableDETRDeformable2021}.
    
    \subsection{Tuberculosis Detection using Machine Learning Methods} \label{sec:ml_tuberculosis_detection} \todo{1-1.5 pages}

    Visuña et al. (2023) \cite{visuna_novel_2023} presented a deep-learning-based technique to detect tuberculosis from sputum smear microscopy images. The author used a one-stage object detection method with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) backbone to detect the presence of bacilli in the images, first fragmenting the image into patches of 80x80 pixels. The model was trained on a dataset of 200 microscopy stain images, achieving a 99.49\% precision and 92.86\% recall on the test set.
