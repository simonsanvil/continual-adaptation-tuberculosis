	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged healthcare systems and research worldwide. Data is collected all over the world and needs to be integrated and made available to other researchers quickly. However, the various heterogeneous information systems that are used in hospitals can result in fragmentation of health data over multiple data ‘silos’ that are not interoperable for analysis. Consequently, clinical observations in hospitalised patients are not prepared to be reused efficiently and timely. There is a need to adapt the research data management in hospitals to make COVID-19 observational patient data machine actionable, i.e. more Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) for humans and machines. We therefore applied the FAIR principles in the hospital to make patient data more FAIR.},

	abstract = {Pharmacometrics (PM) and machine learning (ML) are both valuable for drug development to characterize pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD). Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PKPD) analysis using PM provides mechanistic insight into biological processes but is time- and labor-intensive. In contrast, ML models are much quicker trained, but offer less mechanistic insights. The opportunity of using ML predictions of drug PK as input for a PKPD model could strongly accelerate analysis efforts. Here exemplified by rifampicin, a widely used antibiotic, we explore the ability of different ML algorithms to predict drug PK. Based on simulated data, we trained linear regressions (LASSO), Gradient Boosting Machines, XGBoost and Random Forest to predict the plasma concentration-time series and rifampicin area under the concentration-versus-time curve from 0-24 h (AUC0-24h) after repeated dosing. XGBoost performed best for prediction of the entire PK series (R2: 0.84, root mean square error (RMSE): 6.9 mg/L, mean absolute error (MAE): 4.0 mg/L) for the scenario with the largest data size. For AUC0-24h prediction, LASSO showed the highest performance (R2: 0.97, RMSE: 29.1 h·mg/L, MAE: 18.8 h·mg/L). Increasing the number of plasma concentrations per patient (0, 2 or 6 concentrations per occasion) improved model performance. For example, for AUC0-24h prediction using LASSO, the R2 was 0.41, 0.69 and 0.97 when using predictors only (no plasma concentrations), 2 or 6 plasma concentrations per occasion as input, respectively. Run times for the ML models ranged from 1.0 s to 8 min, while the run time for the PM model was more than 3 h. Furthermore, building a PM model is more time- and labor-intensive compared with ML. ML predictions of drug PK could thus be used as input into a PKPD model, enabling time-efficient analysis.},

	abstract = {Sample size estimation is a crucial step in experimental design but is understudied in the context of deep learning. Currently, estimating the quantity of labeled data needed to train a classifier to a desired performance, is largely based on prior experience with similar models and problems or on untested heuristics. In many supervised machine learning applications, data labeling can be expensive and time-consuming and would benefit from a more rigorous means of estimating labeling requirements. Here, we study the problem of estimating the minimum sample size of labeled training data necessary for training computer vision models as an exemplar for other deep learning problems. We consider the problem of identifying the minimal number of labeled data points to achieve a generalizable representation of the data, a minimum converging sample (MCS). We use autoencoder loss to estimate the MCS for fully connected neural network classifiers. At sample sizes smaller than the MCS estimate, fully connected networks fail to distinguish classes, and at sample sizes above the MCS estimate, generalizability strongly correlates with the loss function of the autoencoder. We provide an easily accessible, code-free, and dataset-agnostic tool to estimate sample sizes for fully connected networks. Taken together, our findings suggest that MCS and convergence estimation are promising methods to guide sample size estimates for data collection and labeling prior to training deep learning models in computer vision.},

	abstract = {The accuracy of deep learning, i.e., deep neural networks, can be characterized by dividing the total error into three main types: approximation error, optimization error, and generalization error. Whereas there are some satisfactory answers to the problems of approximation and optimization, much less is known about the theory of generalization. Most existing theoretical works for generalization fail to explain the performance of neural networks in practice. To derive a meaningful bound, we study the generalization error of neural networks for classification problems in terms of data distribution and neural network smoothness. We introduce the cover complexity (CC) to measure the difficulty of learning a data set and the inverse of the modulus of continuity to quantify neural network smoothness. A quantitative bound for expected accuracy/error is derived by considering both the CC and neural network smoothness. Although most of the analysis is general and not specific to neural networks, we validate our theoretical assumptions and results numerically for neural networks by several data sets of images. The numerical results confirm that the expected error of trained networks scaled with the square root of the number of classes has a linear relationship with respect to the CC. We also observe a clear consistency between test loss and neural network smoothness during the training process. In addition, we demonstrate empirically that the neural network smoothness decreases when the network size increases whereas the smoothness is insensitive to training dataset size.},

	abstract = {Recent work has uncovered the interesting (and somewhat surprising) finding that training models to be invariant to adversarial perturbations requires substantially larger datasets than those required for standard classification. This result is a key hurdle in the deployment of robust machine learning models in many real world applications where labeled data is expensive. Our main insight is that unlabeled data can be a competitive alternative to labeled data for training adversarially robust models. Theoretically, we show that in a simple statistical setting, the sample complexity for learning an adversarially robust model from unlabeled data matches the fully supervised case up to constant factors. On standard datasets like CIFAR- 10, a simple Unsupervised Adversarial Training (UAT) approach using unlabeled data improves robust accuracy by 21.7\% over using 4K supervised examples alone, and captures over 95\% of the improvement from the same number of labeled examples. Finally, we report an improvement of 4\% over the previous state-of-the- art on CIFAR-10 against the strongest known attack by using additional unlabeled data from the uncurated 80 Million Tiny Images dataset. This demonstrates that our finding extends as well to the more realistic case where unlabeled data is also uncurated, therefore opening a new avenue for improving adversarial training.},

	abstract = {Generative foundation models are susceptible to implicit biases that can arise from extensive unsupervised training data. Such biases can produce suboptimal samples, skewed outcomes, and unfairness, with potentially significant repercussions. Consequently, aligning these models with human ethics and preferences is an essential step toward ensuring their responsible and effective deployment in real-world applications. Prior research has primarily employed Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) as a means of addressing this problem, wherein generative models are fine-tuned using RL algorithms guided by a human-feedback-informed reward model. However, the inefficiencies and instabilities associated with RL algorithms frequently present substantial obstacles to the successful alignment of generative models, necessitating the development of a more robust and streamlined approach. To this end, we introduce a new framework, Reward rAnked FineTuning (RAFT), designed to align generative models more effectively. Utilizing a reward model and a sufficient number of samples, our approach selects the high-quality samples, discarding those that exhibit undesired behavior, and subsequently assembles a streaming dataset. This dataset serves as the basis for aligning the generative model and can be employed under both offline and online settings. Notably, the sample generation process within RAFT is gradient-free, rendering it compatible with black-box generators. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed algorithm exhibits strong performance in the context of both large language models and diffusion models.},

	abstract = {Objectives
Named entity recognition (NER), a sequential labeling task, is one of the fundamental tasks for building clinical natural language processing (NLP) systems. Machine learning (ML) based approaches can achieve good performance, but they often require large amounts of annotated samples, which are expensive to build due to the requirement of domain experts in annotation. Active learning (AL), a sample selection approach integrated with supervised ML, aims to minimize the annotation cost while maximizing the performance of ML-based models. In this study, our goal was to develop and evaluate both existing and new AL methods for a clinical NER task to identify concepts of medical problems, treatments, and lab tests from the clinical notes.
Methods
Using the annotated NER corpus from the 2010 i2b2/VA NLP challenge that contained 349 clinical documents with 20,423 unique sentences, we simulated AL experiments using a number of existing and novel algorithms in three different categories including uncertainty-based, diversity-based, and baseline sampling strategies. They were compared with the passive learning that uses random sampling. Learning curves that plot performance of the NER model against the estimated annotation cost (based on number of sentences or words in the training set) were generated to evaluate different active learning and the passive learning methods and the area under the learning curve (ALC) score was computed.
Results
Based on the learning curves of F-measure vs. number of sentences, uncertainty sampling algorithms outperformed all other methods in ALC. Most diversity-based methods also performed better than random sampling in ALC. To achieve an F-measure of 0.80, the best method based on uncertainty sampling could save 66\% annotations in sentences, as compared to random sampling. For the learning curves of F-measure vs. number of words, uncertainty sampling methods again outperformed all other methods in ALC. To achieve 0.80 in F-measure, in comparison to random sampling, the best uncertainty based method saved 42\% annotations in words. But the best diversity based method reduced only 7\% annotation effort.
Conclusion
In the simulated setting, AL methods, particularly uncertainty-sampling based approaches, seemed to significantly save annotation cost for the clinical NER task. The actual benefit of active learning in clinical NER should be further evaluated in a real-time setting.},

This reduces the cost of human oversight far enough that it can be practically applied to state-of-the-art RL systems. To demonstrate the flexibility of our approach, we show that we can successfully train complex novel behaviors with about an hour of human time.

	abstract = {Molecular tests for tuberculosis (TB) have the potential to help reach the three million people with TB who are undiagnosed or not reported each year and to improve the quality of care TB patients receive by providing accurate, quick results, including rapid drug-susceptibility testing. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended the use of molecular nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) tests for TB detection instead of smear microscopy, as they are able to detect TB more accurately, particularly in patients with paucibacillary disease and in people living with HIV. Importantly, some of these WHO-endorsed tests can detect mycobacterial gene mutations associated with anti-TB drug resistance, allowing clinicians to tailor effective TB treatment. Currently, a wide array of molecular tests for TB detection is being developed and evaluated, and while some tests are intended for reference laboratory use, others are being aimed at the point-of-care and peripheral health care settings. Notably, there is an emergence of molecular tests designed, manufactured, and rolled out in countries with high TB burden, of which some are explicitly aimed for near-patient placement. These developments should increase access to molecular TB testing for larger patient populations. With respect to drug susceptibility testing, NAATs and next-generation sequencing can provide results substantially faster than traditional phenotypic culture. Here, we review recent advances and developments in molecular tests for detecting TB as well as anti-TB drug resistance.},

	abstract = {Background: Xpert® MTB/RIF, a rapid tuberculosis (TB) molecular test, was endorsed by the World Health Organization in 2010. Since then, 34.4 million cartridges have been procured under concessional pricing. Although the roll out of this diagnostic is promising, previous studies showed low market penetration. Methods: To assess 3-year trends of market penetration of Xpert MTB/RIF in the public sector, smear and Xpert MTB/RIF volumes for the year 2016 were evaluated and policies from 2014-2016 within 22 high-burden countries (HBCs) were studied. A structured questionnaire was sent to representatives of 22 HBCs. The questionnaires assessed the total smear and Xpert MTB/RIF volumes, number of modules and days of operation of GeneXpert machines in National TB Programs (NTPs). Data regarding the use of NTP GeneXpert machines for other diseases and GeneXpert procurement by other disease control programs were collected. Market penetration was estimated by the ratio of total sputum smear volume for initial diagnosis divided by the number of Xpert MTB/RIF tests procured in the public sector. Results: The survey response rate was 21/22 (95\%). Smear/Xpert ratios decreased in 17/21 countries and increased in four countries, since 2014. The median ratio decreased from 32.6 (IQR: 44.6) in 2014 to 6.0 (IQR: 15.4) in 2016. In 2016, the median GeneXpert utilization was 20\%, however seven countries (7/19; 37\%) were running tests for other diseases on their NTP-procured GeneXpert systems in 2017, such as HIV, hepatitis-C virus (HCV), Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Five (5/15; 33\%) countries reported GeneXpert procurement by HIV or HCV programs in 2016 and/or 2017. Conclusions: Our results show a positive trend for Xpert MTB/RIF market penetration in 21 HBC public sectors. However, GeneXpert machines were under-utilized for TB, and inadequately exploited as a multi disease technology.},

More than 16 million tests have been performed in 122 countries since 2011, and detection of multidrug-resistant TB has increased three- to eight-fold compared to conventional testing. The roll-out has galvanised stakeholders, from donors to civil society, and paved the way for universal drug susceptibility testing. It has attracted new product developers to TB, resulting in a robust molecular diagnostics pipeline. However, the roll-out has also highlighted gaps that have constrained scale-up and limited impact on patient outcomes. The roll-out has been hampered by high costs for under-funded programmes, unavailability of a complete solution package (notably comprehensive training, quality assurance, implementation plans, inadequate service and maintenance support) and lack of impact assessment. Insufficient focus has been afforded to effective linkage to care of diagnosed patients, and clinical impact has been blunted by weak health systems. In many countries the private sector plays a dominant role in TB control, yet this sector has limited access to subsidised pricing. In light of these lessons, we advocate for a comprehensive diagnostics implementation approach, including increased engagement of in-country stakeholders for product launch and roll-out, broader systems strengthening in preparation for new technologies, as well as quality impact data from programmatic settings.},

	abstract = {Editor's Note: This issue of In the Clinic has been updated. One third of the world population has Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection (1). Despite recent progress in the United States, tuberculosis infection remains prevalent in immigrants, immunosuppressed persons, and other high-risk groups (3). Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is the most prevalent form of tuberculosis in the United States (2). LTBI can progress to active tuberculosis disease, especially in individuals with a suppressed cell-mediated immunity. Active tuberculosis disease in immuno-suppressed patients can be difficult to diagnose and can progress to disseminated forms of tuberculosis disease associated with high mortality (4). New methods of diagnosing tuberculosis disease have entered practice in recent years (5), but the diagnosis of LTBI can be challenging in some high-risk populations (6, 7). The introduction of directly observed therapy with first-line antituberculous regimens (8) was an important advance in therapy, but multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and the extensively resistant form of MDR-TB remain significant threats to international and local tuberculosis control efforts (9, 10). Screening and Prevention Who should be screened for tuberculosis? Clinicians should screen all individuals at risk for tuberculosis infection, including close contacts of persons who have active pulmonary tuberculosis. Table 1 identifies asymptomatic individuals who should be screened because they are at high risk for exposure to active tuberculosis or at high risk for disease once infected. Table 1. Risk Factors for Tuberculosis Infection or Progression to Disease After Infection What tests are used to screen for tuberculosis? The tuberculin skin test (TST) with purified protein derivative (PPD) and the Mantoux method have been in use for more than 100 years to screen for tuberculosis. The TST result may not become positive for 8 to 10 weeks after exposure to active tuberculosis. The TST can give false-positive results in patient with previous bacille Calmette-Gurin (BCG) vaccination or other mycobacterial infections and false-negative results in anergic or immunosuppressed patients; however, previous BCG vaccination should not change the interpretation of the TST in most adults. The newer interferon- release assays (IGRAs), including the 2 U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved commercial tests (T-SPOT.TB [Oxford Immunotec, Oxford, United Kingdom], and QuantiFERON-TB Gold and its In-tube version [Cellestis, Valencia, California]) can also be used in circumstances in which the TST is currently used (11). IGRAs assess the T-cell lymphocyte response to specific M. tuberculosis antigens (for example, ESAT-6 and CFP-10) and are more specific, and possibly more sensitive, than TST (12, 13). However, information about IGRA performance is limited in immunocompromised patients and patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy (6, 14). The commercially available IGRAs also have limitations; indeterminate results can occur in immunosuppressed patients, more so with QuantiFERON TB Gold than T-SPOT.TB (6). Discordant results between TST and IGRA testing also occur in about 20\% of individuals (13), which could be related, at least in part, to differences in performance characteristics of these tests (5) and to characteristics of the studied populations, such as the prevalence of persons previously vaccinated with BCG and the proportion of persons born outside the United States (15, 16). In addition to their improved specificity compared with TST, IGRAs have several practical advantages. They do not require a second visit for reading and they do not trigger amnestic responses. Longitudinal data supporting the predictive value of IGRA testing is limited, however, in contrast to the many studies of TST for predicting active tuberculosis (17). A recent study from a high-incidence area of tuberculosis in Africa found that initial test results were positive in only 56\% of TST testing and 52\% of IGRA testing in close household contacts who developed active tuberculosis during 2 years of follow up. Of these close household contacts who developed active tuberculosis, 71\% had a positive result with either TST or IGRA during their initial evaluations (18). Another prospective study (19) from a country with a low incidence of tuberculosis suggests that IGRA testing could be more accurate than TST for diagnosing LTBI and for detecting individuals who will progress to active tuberculosis, but more longitudinal data are needed, especially in immunosuppressed individuals. What can patients do to reduce their likelihood of becoming infected with tuberculosis? Tuberculosis is mainly transmitted by the airborne route from a patient with respiratory symptoms, and its ability to infect others decreases significantly after 2 weeks of effective therapy (20, 22). Therefore, prevention of tuberculosis transmission involves promptly identifying and treating patients with active tuberculosis. For hospitalized patients, prevention includes isolating patients with tuberculosis from other patients and strictly applying other hospital infection control practices (23, 24). Patients usually can be removed from airborne infection isolation when they are no longer considered infectious. Patients are no longer infectious when they are on adequate tuberculosis drug therapy, have had a significant clinical response to therapy, and have had negative results on 3 consecutive sputum smears for acid-fast bacilli (AFB). Some patients can be isolated from outsiders at home after appropriate evaluation and the initiation of outpatient treatment. Isolation of patients at home assumes that household contacts already have been exposed and that further exposure will not affect their outcomes. Two studies, one in India and one in Arkansas, showed similar rates of disease or infection in exposed household contacts whether the patient was admitted to the hospital or allowed to remain at home for initial treatment (25, 26). However, if household contacts of the patients with infectious tuberculosis are at high risk (for example, infants or immuno-compromised persons), housing the patient elsewhere until he or she meets noninfectious criteria should be strongly considered. Hospitalization may be required until housing can be obtained (27). Educating health care workers to evaluate exposed persons for active tuberculosis by obtaining sputum for AFB testing when they have respiratory symptoms has been shown to improve the case detection rates in primary care settings (28). What should clinicians tell patients with active tuberculosis to protect household members and other contacts from infection? Clinicians should teach patients to cough into disposable tissues and to cover their nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing to contain droplet nuclei before they are expelled into the air. Patients who are placed in airborne infection isolation rooms should be educated about the transmission of tuberculosis, the reasons for isolation, and the importance of staying in their rooms. Every effort should be made to help the patient follow the isolation policy (29). Hospital employees and physicians who come in contact with an infectious or suspected infectious patient should wear previously fitted particulate respirators certified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health for protection against tuberculosis, which does not include surgical masks. What are the physician's public health responsibilities after making a diagnosis of active tuberculosis? All 50 U.S. states require physicians to notify public health authorities about all patients suspected of having active tuberculosis (22, 23), which can enable identification of other cases and potentially prevent further transmission of tuberculosis in the community. Genetic fingerprinting of tuberculosis isolates during an outbreak can help public health authorities detect tuberculosis infection in the community (30). Clinical Bottom Line: Screening and Prevention Clinicians should screen persons who have close contact with a person who has active pulmonary tuberculosis, and screen other persons who are at high risk for infection or for progression to disease once infected. Clinicians should screen with TST or IGRAs and should prevent infection by identifying and treating persons with active pulmonary tuberculosis. Patient airborn infection isolation is an important part of early treatment and prevention of transmission. Persons who provide care to patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis should wear particulate respirators. Clinicians should notify public health authorities about patients with suspected active tuberculosis. Diagnosis What signs and symptoms suggest active tuberculosis? Although tuberculosis can cause disease in many parts of the body, this article focuses on pulmonary tuberculosis because it is the most common form of the disease. Clinicians should consider a diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis and evaluate patients for tuberculosis if the patient has constitutional or pulmonary signs and symptoms, such as cough longer than 2 to 3 weeks (may not be productive until later in course of disease), hemoptysis (more likely with cavitation and rarely a presenting symptom), chest pain, fever, chills, night sweats, weight loss, easy fatigability, or anorexia. Some patients have classic signs and symptoms, but it is rare for someone to have most of the classic signs and symptoms except in advanced disease, and many patients will have few of them. Some patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis infection can be fairly asymptomatic.

In our approach, the parameters of the model are explicitly trained such that a small number of gradient steps with a small amount of training data from a new task will produce good generalization performance on that task. In effect, our method trains the model to be easy to fine-tune. We demonstrate that this approach leads to state-of-the-art performance on two few-shot image classification benchmarks, produces good results on few-shot regression, and accelerates fine-tuning for policy gradient reinforcement learning with neural network policies.},

This paradigm provides an opportunity to tackle many conventional challenges of deep learning, including data and computation bottlenecks, as well as generalization. This survey describes the contemporary meta-learning landscape. We first discuss definitions of meta-learning and position it with respect to related fields, such as transfer learning and hyperparameter optimization.

We show the teacher network can learn to better transfer knowledge to the student network (i.e., learning to teach) with the feedback from the performance of the distilled student network in a meta learning framework. Moreover, we introduce a pilot update mechanism to improve the alignment between the inner-learner and meta-learner in meta learning algorithms that focus on an improved inner-learner. Experiments on various benchmarks show that MetaDistil can yield significant improvements compared with traditional KD algorithms and is less sensitive to the choice of different student capacity and hyperparameters, facilitating the use of KD on different tasks and models.},

	abstract = {A very simple way to improve the performance of almost any machine learning algorithm is to train many different models on the same data and then to average their predictions. Unfortunately, making predictions using a whole ensemble of models is cumbersome and may be too computationally expensive to allow deployment to a large number of users, especially if the individual models are large neural nets. Caruana and his collaborators have shown that it is possible to compress the knowledge in an ensemble into a single model which is much easier to deploy and we develop this approach further using a different compression technique. We achieve some surprising results on MNIST and we show that we can significantly improve the acoustic model of a heavily used commercial system by distilling the knowledge in an ensemble of models into a single model. We also introduce a new type of ensemble composed of one or more full models and many specialist models which learn to distinguish fine-grained classes that the full models confuse. Unlike a mixture of experts, these specialist models can be trained rapidly and in parallel.},

Images are captured from Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stained tissue slides using light microscope as it is commonly used approach for diagnosis of TB. Then colour image segmentation is used to locate the regions correspond to the bacilli. After that, affine moment invariants are extracted to represent the segmented regions. These features are invariant under rotation, scale and translation, thus useful to represent the bacilli. Finally, a single layer feedforward neural network (SLFNN) trained by Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is used to detect and classify the features into three classes: ‘TB’, ‘overlapped TB’ and ‘non-TB’.

	abstract = {Ziehl–Neelsen stained microscopy is a crucial bacteriological test for tuberculosis detection, but its sensitivity is poor. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation, 300 viewfields should be analyzed to augment sensitivity, but only a few viewfields are examined due to patient load. Therefore, tuberculosis diagnosis through automated capture of the focused image (autofocusing), stitching of viewfields to form mosaics (autostitching), and automatic bacilli segmentation (grading) can significantly improve the sensitivity. However, the lack of unified datasets impedes the development of robust algorithms in these three domains. Therefore, the Ziehl–Neelsen sputum smear microscopy image database (ZNSM iDB) has been developed, and is freely available. This database contains seven categories of diverse datasets acquired from three different bright-field microscopes. Datasets related to autofocusing, autostitching, and manually segmenting bacilli can be used for developing algorithms, whereas the other four datasets are provided to streamline the sensitivity and specificity. All three categories of datasets were validated using different automated algorithms. As images available in this database have distinctive presentations with high noise and artifacts, this referral resource can also be used for the validation of robust detection algorithms. The ZNSM-iDB also assists for the development of methods in automated microscopy.},

Our empirical results suggest that the cluster structure of the underlying problem and the non-linearity of the expert are pivotal to the success of MoE. To further understand this, we consider a challenging classification problem with intrinsic cluster structures, which is hard to learn using a single expert. Yet with the MoE layer, by choosing the experts as two-layer nonlinear convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we show that the problem can be learned successfully. Furthermore, our theory shows that the router can learn the cluster-center features, which helps divide the input complex problem into simpler linear classification sub-problems that individual experts can conquer. To our knowledge, this is the first result towards formally understanding the mechanism of the MoE layer for deep learning.},

MoEs are a natural fit for a multimodal backbone, since expert layers can learn an appropriate partitioning of modalities. However, new challenges arise; in particular, training stability and balanced expert utilization, for which we propose an entropy-based regularization scheme. Across multiple scales, we demonstrate remarkable performance improvement over dense models of equivalent computational cost. LIMoE-L/16 trained comparably to CLIP-L/14 achieves 78.6\% zero-shot ImageNet accuracy (vs. 76.2\%), and when further scaled to H/14 (with additional data) it achieves 84.1\%, comparable to state-of-the-art methods which use larger custom per-modality backbones and pre-training schemes.

	abstract = {Neural networks are both computationally intensive and memory intensive, making them difficult to deploy on embedded systems with limited hardware resources. To address this limitation, we introduce "deep compression", a three stage pipeline: pruning, trained quantization and Huffman coding, that work together to reduce the storage requirement of neural networks by 35x to 49x without affecting their accuracy. Our method first prunes the network by learning only the important connections. Next, we quantize the weights to enforce weight sharing, finally, we apply Huffman coding. After the first two steps we retrain the network to fine tune the remaining connections and the quantized centroids. Pruning, reduces the number of connections by 9x to 13x; Quantization then reduces the number of bits that represent each connection from 32 to 5. On the ImageNet dataset, our method reduced the storage required by AlexNet by 35x, from 240MB to 6.9MB, without loss of accuracy. Our method reduced the size of VGG-16 by 49x from 552MB to 11.3MB, again with no loss of accuracy. This allows fitting the model into on-chip SRAM cache rather than off-chip DRAM memory. Our compression method also facilitates the use of complex neural networks in mobile applications where application size and download bandwidth are constrained. Benchmarked on CPU, GPU and mobile GPU, compressed network has 3x to 4x layerwise speedup and 3x to 7x better energy efficiency.},

	abstract = {Pruning a neural net consists of removing weights without degrading its performance. This is an old problem of renewed interest because of the need to compress ever larger nets so they can run in mobile devices. Pruning has been traditionally done by ranking or penalizing weights according to some criterion (such as magnitude), removing low-ranked weights and retraining the remaining ones. We formulate pruning as an optimization problem of finding the weights that minimize the loss while satisfying a pruning cost condition. We give a generic algorithm to solve this which alternates "learning" steps that optimize a regularized, data-dependent loss and "compression" steps that mark weights for pruning in a data-independent way. Magnitude thresholding arises naturally in the compression step, but unlike existing magnitude pruning approaches, our algorithm explores subsets of weights rather than committing irrevocably to a specific subset from the beginning. It is also able to learn automatically the best number of weights to prune in each layer of the net without incurring an exponentially costly model selection. Using a single pruning-level user parameter, we achieve state-of-the-art pruning in LeNet and ResNets of various sizes.},

The codebook can be optimally learned jointly with the net, or fixed, as for binarization or ternarization approaches. Previous work has quantized the weights of the reference net, or incorporated rounding operations in the backpropagation algorithm, but this has no guarantee of converging to a loss-optimal, quantized net. We describe a new approach based on the recently proposed framework of model compression as constrained optimization {\textbackslash}citep\{Carreir17a\}. This results in a simple iterative "learning-compression" algorithm, which alternates a step that learns a net of continuous weights with a step that quantizes (or binarizes/ternarizes) the weights, and is guaranteed to converge to local optimum of the loss for quantized nets. We develop algorithms for an adaptive codebook or a (partially) fixed codebook. The latter includes binarization, ternarization, powers-of-two and other important particular cases. We show experimentally that we can achieve much higher compression rates than previous quantization work (even using just 1 bit per weight) with negligible loss degradation.},

	abstract = {Today’s world is witnessing a shift from human-written software to machine-learned software, with the rise of systems that rely on machine learning. These systems typically operate in non-static environments, which are prone to unexpected changes, as is the case of self-driving cars and enterprise systems. In this context, machine-learned software can misbehave. Thus, it is paramount that these systems are capable of detecting problems with their machined-learned components and adapting themselves to maintain desired qualities. For instance, a fraud detection system that cannot adapt its machine-learned model to efficiently cope with emerging fraud patterns or changes in the volume of transactions is subject to losses of millions of dollars. In this paper, we take a first step towards the development of a framework for self-adaptation of systems that rely on machine-learned components. We describe: (i) a set of causes of machine-learned component misbehavior and a set of adaptation tactics inspired by the literature on machine learning, motivating them with the aid of two running examples from the enterprise systems and cyber-physical systems domains; (ii) the required changes to the MAPE-K loop, a popular control loop for self-adaptive systems; and (iii) the challenges associated with developing this framework. We conclude with a set of research questions to guide future work.KeywordsSelf-adaptive systemsMachine learningModel degradationLearning-enabled systemsLearning-enabled components},

	abstract = {The capacity of a neural network to absorb information is limited by its number of parameters. Conditional computation, where parts of the network are active on a per-example basis, has been proposed in theory as a way of dramatically increasing model capacity without a proportional increase in computation. In practice, however, there are significant algorithmic and performance challenges. In this work, we address these challenges and finally realize the promise of conditional computation, achieving greater than 1000x improvements in model capacity with only minor losses in computational efficiency on modern GPU clusters. We introduce a Sparsely-Gated Mixture-of-Experts layer (MoE), consisting of up to thousands of feed-forward sub-networks. A trainable gating network determines a sparse combination of these experts to use for each example. We apply the MoE to the tasks of language modeling and machine translation, where model capacity is critical for absorbing the vast quantities of knowledge available in the training corpora. We present model architectures in which a MoE with up to 137 billion parameters is applied convolutionally between stacked LSTM layers. On large language modeling and machine translation benchmarks, these models achieve significantly better results than state-of-the-art at lower computational cost.},

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) has emerged as the predominant approach for collaborative training of neural network models across multiple users, without the need to gather the data at a central location. One of the important challenges in this setting is data heterogeneity, i.e. different users have different data characteristics. For this reason, training and using a single global model might be suboptimal when considering the performance of each of the individual user’s data. In this work, we tackle this problem via Federated Mixture of Experts, FedMix, a framework that allows us to train an ensemble of specialized models. FedMix adaptively selects and trains a user-speciﬁc selection of the ensemble members. We show that users with similar data characteristics select the same members and therefore share statistical strength while mitigating the effect of non-i.i.d data. Empirically, we show through an extensive experimental evaluation that FedMix improves performance compared to using a single global model across a variety of different sources of non-i.i.d.-ness.},

However, currently, it is challenging to infer the joint representations and learn relationships among multiple modalities from complex multimodal single-cell data. Herein, we present scMM, a novel deep generative model-based framework for the extraction of interpretable joint representations and cross-modal generation. scMM addresses the complexity of data by leveraging a mixture-of-experts multimodal variational autoencoder. The pseudocell generation strategy of scMM compensates for the limited interpretability of deep learning models and discovered multimodal regulatory programs associated with latent dimensions. Analysis of recently produced datasets validated that scMM facilitates high-resolution clustering with rich interpretability. Furthermore, we show that cross-modal generation by scMM leads to more precise prediction and data integration compared with the state-of-the-art and conventional approaches.},

We present the Language-Image MoE, LIMoE, a sparse mixture of experts model capable of multimodal learning. LIMoE accepts both images and text simultaneously, while being trained using a contrastive loss. MoEs are a natural fit for a multimodal backbone, since expert layers can learn an appropriate partitioning of modalities. However, new challenges arise; in particular, training stability and balanced expert utilization, for which we propose an entropy-based regularization scheme. Across multiple scales, we demonstrate remarkable performance improvement over dense models of equivalent computational cost. LIMoE-L/16 trained comparably to CLIP-L/14 achieves 78.6\% zero-shot ImageNet accuracy (vs. 76.2\%), and when further scaled to H/14 (with additional data) it achieves 84.1\%, comparable to state-of-the-art methods which use larger custom per-modality backbones and pre-training schemes. We analyse the quantitative and qualitative behavior of LIMoE, and demonstrate phenomena such as differing treatment of the modalities and the organic emergence of modality-specific experts.},

	abstract = {Sparsely-gated mixture-of-experts (MoE) has been widely adopted to scale deep learning models to trillion-plus parameters with fixed computational cost. The algorithmic performance of MoE relies on its token routing mechanism that forwards each input token to the right sub-models or experts. While token routing dynamically determines the amount of expert workload at runtime, existing systems suffer inefficient computation due to their static execution, namely static parallelism and pipelining, which does not adapt to the dynamic workload. We present Flex, a highly scalable stack design and implementation for MoE with dynamically adaptive parallelism and pipelining. Flex designs an identical layout for distributing MoE model parameters and input data, which can be leveraged by all possible parallelism or pipelining methods without any mathematical inequivalence or tensor migration overhead. This enables adaptive parallelism/pipelining optimization at zero cost during runtime. Based on this key design, Flex also implements various MoE acceleration techniques. Aggregating all techniques, Flex finally delivers huge speedup at any scale -- 4.96x and 5.75x speedup of a single MoE layer over 16 and 2,048 A100 GPUs, respectively, over the previous state-of-the-art. Our evaluation shows that Flex efficiently and effectively runs a real-world MoE-based model named SwinV2-MoE, built upon Swin Transformer V2, a state-of-the-art computer vision architecture. On efficiency, Flex accelerates SwinV2-MoE, achieving up to 1.55x and 2.11x speedup in training and inference over Fairseq, respectively. On effectiveness, the SwinV2-MoE model achieves superior accuracy in both pre-training and down-stream computer vision tasks such as COCO object detection than the counterpart dense model, indicating the readiness of Flex for end-to-end real-world model training and inference.},

	abstract = {The goal of data attribution is to trace model predictions back to training data. Despite a long line of work towards this goal, existing approaches to data attribution tend to force users to choose between computational tractability and efficacy. That is, computationally tractable methods can struggle with accurately attributing model predictions in non-convex settings (e.g., in the context of deep neural networks), while methods that are effective in such regimes require training thousands of models, which makes them impractical for large models or datasets. In this work, we introduce TRAK (Tracing with the Randomly-projected After Kernel), a data attribution method that is both effective and computationally tractable for large-scale, differentiable models. In particular, by leveraging only a handful of trained models, TRAK can match the performance of attribution methods that require training thousands of models. We demonstrate the utility of TRAK across various modalities and scales: image classifiers trained on ImageNet, vision-language models (CLIP), and language models (BERT and mT5). We provide code for using TRAK (and reproducing our work) at https://github.com/MadryLab/trak .},

Our framework encompasses many existing Bayesian methods based on Gaussian process approximations of neural networks as well as non-Bayesian methods. Additionally, we propose to replace the commonly used last-layer features with sketched finite-width neural tangent kernels and to combine them with a novel clustering method. To evaluate different methods, we introduce an open-source benchmark consisting of 15 large tabular regression data sets. Our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art on our benchmark, scales to large data sets, and works out-of-the-box without adjusting the network architecture or training code.

To obtain the Influence of the unlabeled sample in the active learning scenario, we design the Untrained Unlabeled sample Influence Calculation(UUIC) to estimate the unlabeled sample's expected gradient with which we calculate its Influence. To prove the effectiveness of UUIC, we provide both theoretical and experimental analyses. Since the UUIC just depends on the model gradients, which can be obtained easily from any neural network, our active learning algorithm is task-agnostic and model-agnostic. ISAL achieves state-of-the-art performance in different active learning settings for different tasks with different datasets.

	abstract = {The chest X-ray is one of the most commonly accessible radiological examinations for screening and diagnosis of many lung diseases. A tremendous number of X-ray imaging studies accompanied by radiological reports are accumulated and stored in many modern hospitals' Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS). On the other side, it is still an open question how this type of hospital-size knowledge database containing invaluable imaging informatics (i.e., loosely labeled) can be used to facilitate the data-hungry deep learning paradigms in building truly large-scale high precision computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems. In this paper, we present a new chest X-ray database, namely "ChestX-ray8", which comprises 108,948 frontal-view X-ray images of 32,717 unique patients with the text-mined eight disease image labels (where each image can have multi-labels), from the associated radiological reports using natural language processing. Importantly, we demonstrate that these commonly occurring thoracic diseases can be detected and even spatially-located via a unified weakly-supervised multi-label image classification and disease localization framework, which is validated using our proposed dataset. Although the initial quantitative results are promising as reported, deep convolutional neural network based "reading chest X-rays" (i.e., recognizing and locating the common disease patterns trained with only image-level labels) remains a strenuous task for fully-automated high precision CAD systems.

Protein structure prediction is one of the most challenging problems in computational biology and chemistry, and has puzzled scientists for 50 years. The advent of AF2 presents an unprecedented progress in protein structure prediction and has attracted much attention. Subsequent release of structures of more than 200 million proteins predicted by AF2 further aroused great enthusiasm in the science community, especially in the fields of biology and medicine. AF2 is thought to have a significant impact on structural biology and research areas that need protein structure information, such as drug discovery, protein design, prediction of protein function, et al. Though the time is not long since AF2 was developed, there are already quite a few application studies of AF2 in the fields of biology and medicine, with many of them having preliminarily proved the potential of AF2. To better understand AF2 and promote its applications, we will in this article summarize the principle and system architecture of AF2 as well as the recipe of its success, and particularly focus on reviewing its applications in the fields of biology and medicine.

	abstract = {Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort1–4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’8—has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10–14, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},
